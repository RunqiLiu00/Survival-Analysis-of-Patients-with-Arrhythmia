Description
Arrhythmias remain a major health problem, causing at least 250,000 deaths annually in the United States. One treatment for patients with high-risk arrhythmias is to have surgical procedure to install a device called an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator, or ICD. These devices monitor the patientâ€™s heart rate, and if an abnormal rhythm is detected, the device will deliver an electric shock to restore a normal heartbeat. The hope is that these ICDs would prevent sudden cardiac arrest and possible death.

Often, however, it is unclear which patients need ICDs and which patients do not. These data come from a large, multi-hospital study of patients with ICDs, some of which delivered shocks during the course of the study and some of which did not. There are two primary outcomes in this study: overall survival (time until death) and the time until the ICD delivered its first shock. A variety of potentially useful predictors, including demographic, laboratory values, medical history, and electrocardiogram (ECG)-derived variables, are available. The primary goal of the study is to develop a method for identifying high-risk patients most in need of an ICD.
